# Example Payload

A simple example to get started with the Flyby SDK.

# Dependencies
Download the latest stable SDK release and extract it to **external/flyby**. You should have **external/flyby/lib** and **external/flyby/include**. 

# Build

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .

# Running

Run the **ExamplePayload** binary. A server should start with the demo payload, and should be visible through the controller.
